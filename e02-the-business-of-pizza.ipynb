    "We can choose to build on a few of the pizza shop owner's existing strengths to grow their business. This is generally the most prudent course of action because it's what's typically considered \"a good offensive maneuver\" — because after all, you're more likely to win where you're winning the most. \n",

    "| The best garlic pizza in the business | The store owner was trained in Sicily |\n",
    "| ![](assets/garlicpizza.png) | ![](assets/measuring.png) |\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also help make the business more efficient by addressing a few of their weaknesses. This is more of a defensive approach which plays well when a business has a working offense. Starting with one's strengths and then addressing a weakness tends to be a better tactic — but then again, sometimes a business' weakness can kill it so quickly that its strengths never get dialed up in time. Keep in mind that the circumstances are always fluid, and so being *agile* will always matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "| SAMPLE WEAKNESS 1 | SAMPLE WEAKNESS 2 |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| High turnover in under-skilled employees | Calzones are trending but not on the menu | \n",
    "| ![](assets/workersleaving.png) | ![](assets/calzones.png) |\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, with the right balance of leveraging strengths and addressing weaknesses, there may be room for the business to investigate opportunities to grow the business by reaching into new markets with product modifications and/or by launching entirely new products. And as the business attempts to take on more uncertainty and risk, it's prudent for the business to imagine and prepare for how to make itself more resilient. By being more resilient, it becomes possible to take on more risk to reap more rewards. In absence of designing itself for resilience, the business can take on too much risk and fold when an unexpected failure occurs.\n",

And are you also feeling confident that you could easily shift into a different business vertical with the unusual cognitive elasticity afforded to you by LLMs?
